## Introduction

As one of the most popular sports on the planet, football has always been followed
very closely by a large number of people. In recent years, new types of data have
been collected for many games in various countries, such as play-by-play data including information on each shot or pass made in a match.

Information like this can be found in datasets like [the Football Events dataset](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/search?docid=beC2NjeMuiLj9GvLAAAAAA%3D%3D) found on kaggle.

This projects objective is to use the above mentioned dataset to predict the number of goals on a football game using Regression algorithms.
