    "As one of the most popular sports on the planet, football has always been followed\n",
    "very closely by a large number of people. In recent years, new types of data have\n",
    "been collected for many games in various countries, such as play-by-play data including information on each shot or pass made in a match.\n",

    "\n",
    "The data set, and inherently the model, are flawed.\n",
    "In essence, football games present an extremelly non deterministic world. \n",
    "The number of goals a team scores doesn't depend only on the recorded statistics, it also depends on player health, team state of mind, factors that are foreign to the games like club internall conflicts, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to situations were two games of a team that have exactly the same statistics will have different results, due to the circumstances of that time. \n",
    "It also makes it hard to find outliers as we can't choose which behaviour is normal.\n",
    "All of this added together makes regression models have a hard time being accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem is that the dataset holds is missing some data that would be extremelly useful, like ball possession percentages."
